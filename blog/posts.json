			"Content": "In this series of articles I will record the process of developing an Arch Linux distribution. More precisely I will customize an Arch Linux installation step by step - system setup, desktop environment etc - and eventually share it as a Live system. The name of this project will be 'Juicy Linux' ;)<br/><br/>For more information about Arch Linux I suggest to you the following sites: <ul class='square'><li><a href='https://www.archlinux.org/'>Arch Linux main site</a></li><li><a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/'>Excellent Arch Linux Wiki</a> with its</li><li>really helpful <a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide'>Beginner's Guide</a></li></ul>So why am I doing this? And what are the goals of this project? I think there are several answers to that question. On the one hand I need a substitute to my current Mac OSX system. My MacBook Pro is over four years old and it's time to get a new laptop. But as you know Apple products are not always the cheapest. And so I decided to buy just a standard laptop and install Linux. However I want to customize it to fit my needs: that is the look & feel of OSX. But the emphasize is on 'feel'. If it feels good who needs fancy skeuomorphisms? On the other hand I always wanted to create my own personal Linux that's got everything I need in my daily work.<br/><br/>So I thought I take this moment as a chance to do so and share this process with you and maybe discuss about relevant and irrelevant features of a daily-use Linux distribution.<br/><br/>Enough talking - let's get started! The installation of Arch can be a bit tricky for beginners while there is no graphical installer like it's in Ubuntu e.g. But there is the Arch Wiki and hundreds of guides out there that help you with the setup. I will continue the installation on a Virtual Machine for now. In later stages we will transfer the system to a real desktop pc/laptop and test it in the field. While you can follow the <a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide'>Beginner's Guide</a> to get your system up - I will present you my command history in a short form (it wouldn't make sense to go into details here - that has already be done a hundred times ;). <pre>loadkeys en # english keyboard layout (by default) - change it to your needs<br/>dhcpcd # establish internet connection<br/>gdisk /dev/sda # partition the only hard disk<br/># we will use grub2 as a bootloader, so the disk layout is as follows:<br/># - grub: +2M, type EF02<br/># - boot: +100M, type 0800<br/># - root: ..., type 0800<br/># I won't initialize a swap partition - but you can of course!<br/>mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda2 # boot partition<br/>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3 # root<br/>mount /dev/sda3 /mnt # mount our disks<br/>mkdir /mnt/boot<br/>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot<br/># install all neccessary packages - maybe you don't need the wifi stuff (wpa_supplicant)<br/>pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel wpa_supplicant grub-bios<br/>genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab<br/># dive into the new system<br/>arch-chroot /mnt<br/>passwd # set root password<br/>echo 'juicy' > /etc/hostname # set hostname to 'juicy' or whatever you like<br/>echo 'KEYMAP=en' > /etc/vconsole.conf # set default keymap for the next boot<br/>ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Amsterdam /etc/localtime # setup your time zone<br/># optional todo now: setup locales - I will skip this<br/>hwclock --systohc --utc<br/>mkinitcpio -p linux # create ramdisk<br/>grub-install /dev/sda # bootload installation: be sure to select the whole disc!<br/>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg<br/>exit # leave chroot<br/>umount /mnt/boot /mnt # clean up<br/>reboot # done!</pre>This is mostly taken from this <a href='https://gist.github.com/alphazo/3285090'>gist</a>. <br/><br/>In the next section we will talk about the design and specification of the system and begin with some simple but neccessary configurations. Stay tuned!"
