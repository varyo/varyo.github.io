			"Content": "In this series of articles I will record the process of developing an Arch Linux distribution. More precisely I will customize an Arch Linux installation step by step - system setup, desktop environment etc - and eventually share it as a Live system. The name of this project will be \"Juicy Linux\" just because I think that's a good name ;)"
